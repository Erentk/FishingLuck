# FishingLuck
It was developed with Unity 2d. The game includes two fishing boats and various fish species. Each of these fish species has different scores. You control one of the fishing boats while the other is controlled by artificial intelligence. Both players have the right to cast 15 fishing rods. The one with the highest score at the end of the game wins.
